# todos-user

The app is a Restful API built with mongodb, mongoose, express, and node.js. 

It allows different users to sign up, sign in, and do CRUD operations of their own todos.

User passwords are hashed before storing in MongoDB and authentication is implemented with JWT.

You need to use postman to interact with the backend.
